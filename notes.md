* S - Single Responsibility Principle : Each class should have single responsibility
* O - Open/Closed Principle - Open for extension but closed for modification
* L - Liskov Substitution Principle - If class B is subtype of Class A, then we should be able to replace object of A with B withput breaking the behaviour of the program

Subclass should extend capability of parents class and not narrow it down.

* I - Interface Segmented Principle - Interface should be such clients should not implement unnecessary functions they dont need.
* D - Dependency Inversion Principle - Class should depend on interfaces rather than concrete class 


Advantages of above principles:

* Avoid Duplicate code
* Easy to mantain
* Easy to understand
* Flexible software
* Reduce Complexity
